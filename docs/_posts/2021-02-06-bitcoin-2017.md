To understand why Bitcoin had that rise on December 17, 2017 from an astrological point of view I'd like to analyze the transits at that time.

This is the chart with daily candles of the Bitcoin values in December 2017. We can see a rise of approximately 19800 USD on December 17, 2017.

### Slow moving planets transits
Let’s first look at the slow moving planets transits to see what was happening in a global term.

#### Pluto conjuct the Sun and has a trine with Saturn
Pluto conjuct the Sun and has a trine with Saturn
Pluto conjuct the Sun has to do with the fact that at that time the power of Bitcoin was shown. It could have been the destruction of this cryptocurrency but because Bitcoin has a lot of strength, it’s indestructible and came to last over time (as we can see in the [natal chart post](https://astro-cryptos.github.io/docs/bitcoin/bitcoin-natal-chart/)) it did not decay.

I think that this aspects has to do with the mutation that Bitcoin made from this moment. Until 2017 the one who believe in the potential of cryptocurrencies was the one who understood the subject.

On the other hand, this trine between Saturn and Pluto shows us that the conservatives (Saturn) who did not believe in its power, began to see it with different eyes.

#### Neptune sextile to the Stellium
Neptune in this case has to do with speculation, with the bubble that happens at that time. That dissolution that occurs after an overflowing rise.

#### Great trine between Uranus in transit, the cusp of House II and the transit Sun

This means the unexpected price increase.

### Fast moving planets transits
The triggers of the global energy mentioned are the Sun and Mars. The Sun conjuct Pluto shows the power that this cryptocurrency has and the change that Bitcoin had from that moment because as of 2017 it had more adoption. We can also see Mars trine Venus causing its value to rise because as we know Venus represent the value of this cryptocurrency.
