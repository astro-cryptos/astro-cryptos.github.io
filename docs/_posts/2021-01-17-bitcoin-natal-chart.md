There is a phrase that I like: "Businesses are done by information difference". So why not add astrology to the technical and fundamental cryptocurrencies analysis in order to make better businesses.

I started this path of seeing cryptocurrencies from an astrological point of view and I'd like to share it with you to continue learning, so all comments and contributions are welcome.

Well let's go to the Bitcoin birth chart.
In order to make a natal chart of something or someone we need the birth date but in the case of Bitcoin, there are several dates. Which date is the correct one will depend on each astrologer, most of them take the date of the genesis block and I agree with them.

These possible dates are:

- The date that Satoshi Nakamoto registered the domain bitcoin.org on August 18, 2008
- The presentation of the whitepaper on October 31, 2008
- The creation of the Genesis block on January 3, 2009 - 18:05:15 GMT
- The date when the first Bitcoin client was launched on January 9, 2009
- The first transaction between Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal Finney on January 12, 2009 - 03:30:25 GMT

IMO the first transaction seems to be an important date like the date of the genesis creation. The first transaction chart could be taken as a sub-chart of the genesis block chart or directly as the transaction chart. Also, it could be taken to compare it with the genesis block. 

I will make a clarification here, for the creation of the genesis block and for the first transaction we have the UTC time (GMT-0), but we don't have the location. 
It's unknown where Satoshi was that date, it's assumed that he was in London but we donâ€™t know. I use the topocentric house system because for me it seems to be the most accurate one but to know where the ascendant and the cusps of the houses are, we need to know the place where the genesis was created or where the first transaction occurred. I take London as the location because it seems to me that the chart that works better.

### Elements and modality
First, we can see the preponderance of fire and earth meaning Bitcoin is here to stay, that it is dynamic. The cardinal and fixed modality shows that is a pioneering and persistent cryptocurrency.

### The Bitcoin Sun is in Capricorn
What does it mean? it means that it's a cryptocurrency that will continue escalating and every time it goes for more, that it came to last over time, that it's serious. It's an ambitious cryptocurrency. It's a cryptocurrency that came to give another form to the economy as we know today.

Capricorn is a sign where what has been achieved will be appreciated over time and I think that is what we are seeing today with Bitcoin.
The sun in Capricorn can also tell us about a cryptocurrency with an upward trend.

### Ascendant in Leo
The ascendant in Leo means that Bitcoin is the new digital gold (if the genesis block was created in London).
This also has to do with the fact that this cryptocurrency is the best known. We could say that it's the  brightest one, the most valuable. Also a kind of leader because the other cryptos were following Bitcoin.

### Moon in Aries
The moon represents the public. This public seems to be impulsive when it comes to buying and selling. In other words, an audience that does not stop to think too much.
On the other hand it represents the volatility of this cryptocurrency.

The moon rules the 12th house, perhaps this volatility is what Bitcoin should leave behind to be considered as digital gold. Without a doubt Bitcoin has already started the path to became as gold. 

### Stellium in Capricorn (Mars, Pluto and the Sun)
Mars exalted conjuct Pluto is a fulminant force. It's an ambitious and very well planned project.
If Bitcoin were a person, it would be a super competitive warrior who cannot be stopped and who has a lot of strength to get up if he falls. It's a powerful coin. For me is the warrior who comes to destroy the financial system as we known until now. And this force is sustained over time.

### Venus is exalted in Pisces.
 We can clearly see that it's the money that is in the hands of everyone  without being controlled by governments or corporations. With venus in Pisces we can see the descentralization. You could even say that he has the empathy for us all to win. Venus in Pisces gives Bitcoin a value that transcends and is overflowing. Venus is in the best celestial position.
Although it can also refer to speculations regarding its value but as I said is in the best place.
I think that Venus conjunct Neptune embracing the cusp of VIII accentuates that it's decentralized.

### Mercury exalted in Aquarius
Mercury represents transactions. Mercury in Aquarius is the radical change in the way in which we are going to transfer money.
The Bitcoin was made to have peer to peer transactions and this can be seen for being in the aquarium.
Mercury It's also significant of the press or news about Bitcoin. It would be good to see the transits to Mercury to see how the news can influence over Bitcoin.

### Mars exalted in Capricorn
As I mentioned before, if it were a person it would be a true warrior, a long-term strategist who has the patience and perseverance to reach the objectives. It's what we are seeing today with Bitcoin, it's  growing over time.
This exalted Mars is leading and ascending but always with prudence, planning and perseverance (Capricorn).


### The chronocators trine
It's the constancy to be a great cryptocurrency. It's the slow but sure success. This aspect with Mars exalted shows a structure leading coin.
If it were a person it would be the great teacher.
This aspect also makes it easy to find a solution to obstacles that could appear.

Uranus in Pisces and Neptune in Aquarius are in mutual reception. It represents the decentralization of this technology.

### Uranus opposition Saturn
IMO this aspect refers to the technical aspects of the currency that are not in agreement with the authority.
Also, is significant of the decentralized disruption. 
Another meaning is that Bitcoin is based on the blockchain (block -> Saturn and chain -> Uranus).

### Mars conjuct Pluto square moon
I think it has to do with the tension that arises from the volatility that Bitcoin has.
